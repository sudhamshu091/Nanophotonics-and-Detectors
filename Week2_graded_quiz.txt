1.Question 1
Spontaneous emission is an intrinsic property of an atom.
Ans:False
2.Question 2
Why is photon density of modes different for 2D, 1D and 0D structures ?
Ans:Number of allowed states as a function of energy is a function of confinement
3.Question 3
What is the definition of \betaβ, the spontaneous emission enhancement factor?
Ans:Fraction of total spontaneous emission that is coupled into lasing cavity mode
4.Question 4
A thresholdless laser does not have a threshold.
Ans:False
5.Question 5
Why are whispering gallery mode lasers attractive?
Ans:All of the above(Small mode volume
		     Low threshold
	             Nonlinear effects can be enhanced with high intensities)
6.Question 6
What are main differences between photonic crystals and crystalline semiconductors in respect to calculating bandstructure for photons and electrons/holes respectively?
Ans:(a) and (b) are correct(Different occupation probabilities for electron/holes and photons
			    Photons do not have mass whereas electrons do)
