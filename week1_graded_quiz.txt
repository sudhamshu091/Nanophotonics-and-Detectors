1.Question 1
How does the quantum cascade laser allow operation at long wavelengths?
Ans:Intersubband transitions in layered structures
2.Question 2
Why is it hard to generate short wavelengths from quantum cascade lasers?
Ans:Losses of carriers due to thermionic emission
3.Question 3
Ans:1/E
4.Question 4
What is the advantage of a quantum dot laser?
Ans:All the above(They have higher gain than quantum well or bulk lasers,
                  They have a lower threshold than quantum well or bulk lasers.
                  Enable lasing in materials systems where it is not possible with other means)
